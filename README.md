# SONALAKE_Assessment

Mobile operators (eir, Three, Vodafone etc.) face congestion problems in their networks due to increased usage and other factors. Congested sites (cellular base stations) will lose revenue because usage at these sites is curtailed.  In an environment where the operators have finite resources to address congestion (be it through building new capacity or upgrading existing sites) they require a solution that will give them future visibility of congestion in order to prioritise their medium to long term investments. 

Sonalake’s customer, a successful telecoms operator has engaged us to:
●	Get a 14-day forecast on their network usage KPI, 
●	Find out if they would face congestion, within 14 days in the future,
●	Get meaningful insights and recommendations according to your findings.

They have provided a 3-month historical data set with hourly granularity and a threshold level.

●	Data Set: The data set comprises 3-month (61 days) historical timeseries data with hourly granularity. It includes two fields showing the time stamp (days/hours) and the network value (in Gbps).

●	Threshold Level: When a value exceeds and breaches the threshold level (16.40 Gbps) given in the data set, it means that the network is congested at that point
